 ## Usage
 * Given a dating site for seniors, when I visit the site for the first time I am presented with the homepage, which includes a welcome message advising me to either log in or sign up, provides guidance as to the the security and confidential nature of the site, testimonials from customers, and provides the options to either log-in or sign-up. 
 * When I choose to sign up, I am taken to a page where I am asked to enter predetermined demographic information on myself and my dating interest, and prompted to create a username and password. 
 * When I click on the submit button in the sign-up page, my user information and credentials are saved, I am prompte to choose whether I want the basic or paid subscription.  
 * If I choose the basic (free) subscription, I am logged in. If I choose the paid subscription, I am prompted for my payment information and once that information is verified, I am logged in. 
 * When I log in for the first time, then I am taken to a landing page where I have a dashboard-style display of how many people have seen my profile on a no-name basis, and I am provided with potential matches. 
 * When I click on the link to a potential match profile, I am taken to their profile page where basic information is displayed and I am given the option to start a conversation. 
 * Once I choose to start a conversation, I am presented with the message title, contents, message creatorâ€™s username, and date created for that message. 
 * Once I complete the message, I am given the option to send or cancel the message. If I choose to cancel, the message is cleared. 
 * If I click the send button, the message is sent and saved, displying the creator's username and date it was created. The receiver of the message will have the option to respond to the message, requiring the platform to have a log of the conversation. 
 * If the user is a paid subscriber and agrees to meet with their match, the user can use the recommendation option provided in the message board to recieve a suggestion of where to meet. 
 * When I click on one of my existing message board in the dashboard, I am able to delete or update my message and taken back to an updated dashboard. 
 * If the user and the match decide to unmatch and disconnect, they can choose to do so from an unmatch button located in the dashboard page. 
 * When I click on the logout option in the dashboard page, I am signed out of the site. 
 * When I am idle on the site for more than a set time, I am able to view comments but I am prompted to log in again before I can add, update, or delete comments.
